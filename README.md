# Welcome to the Colosseum

Here I'm developing a turn-based, strategic combat game. The main application is React, and Auth0 have been implemented to allow users register and save their progress through the game.
Fetching true Dungeons & Dragons enemies and equipment from the D&D Api, you will have to face sucessives waves of each time stronger foes. Survive and you will earn gold and fame to buy bigger swords, more potions amd grow stronger. 

How long will you be able to survive?

## To Do List / Priorities


- [x] Combat engine - simple fights can be disputed between simplified models of player and enemies
- [x] Define characters with a variety of stats and abilities to add complexity to the system
- [ ] Fetch equipment and enemies from D&D API according to the level of the player
- [ ] Integrate a shop feature where to spend your hard earned credits for power ups
- [ ] Allow authentication and save the game state linked to the user in MongoDB
- [ ] A creative and neat user interface
- [ ] To balance potential game-breaking mechanics(overpowered characters and so)

It is not a short task and not only a game, but a challenge to put into practice all the knowledge and skills I have learnt these last months of Bootcamp, as it covers great part of the technologies we have been introduce too. There is no better way of improving yourself than doing what you love. Or at least not funnier.
